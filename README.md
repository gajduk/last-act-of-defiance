Last Act of Defiance
========================

An MFC based side-scrolling shooter with custom code-generated graphics and animations.
Made almost entirely from scratch without using any external libraries.

---------------------

Features 2 different basic weapons, a super weapon and 2 types of special power ups: a deflector shield, a time warp and a repair kit.
The game has 4 difficulty settings, an auto-fire option and an endless swarm of enemies for you to destroy.

Made for fun during a summer break when I was in my 2nd year of Computer Science studies at the Faculty in Skopje.


Are you ready for your last act of defiance?
